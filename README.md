# Booter Databases Analyses

This Github repository presents scripts used to analyse Booter Databases. Those scripts support an academic publication (under-reviewing process) entitled: "Helping the Future of Cyber Teenagers - Facilitating Analysis and Notification of People Associated with Booter DDoS Database". As soon the paper get published we intend to release all analyses. 

## From now, an example of Booter database analysis is available [HERE!](case_studies/vddos/analysis_vddos.ipynb)
